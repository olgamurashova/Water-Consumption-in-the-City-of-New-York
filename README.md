## Water Consumption in the City of New York

### Project description

In this project, I analyzed water consumption rate per year in the City of New York. The dataset represents a brief history of water consumption in the New York City Water Supply System (Based on New York City Census population). The dataset is available [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Water-Consumption-in-the-City-of-New-York/ia2d-e54m). 

According to the dataset, the consumption rate of water (million gallons per day) was the highest in 1979, and the lowest in 2020:

The population of New York City has been steadily growing(the snapshot below displays data starting 2000) according to the dataset. As displayed below, the population rate declined in 2019 and 2020 which may be related to the coronavirus pandemic.
